" submitting a Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) report </user/hardware/how-"

"to it in your issue. You may also need to use command-line tools such as "
"``lspci``. If you’re reporting a bug in a package that is in a :doc:`testing"
" </user/downloading-installing-upgrading/testing>` repository, please "
"reference the appropriate issue in the `updates-status "
"<https://github.com/QubesOS/updates-status/issues>`__ repository. Project "
"maintainers really appreciate thorough explanations. It usually helps them "
"address the problem more quickly, so everyone wins!"

"Qubes OS is an operating system built out of securely-isolated compartments "
"called `qubes </user/reference/glossary.html#qube>`__. For example, you "
"might have a work qube, a personal qube, a banking qube, a web browsing "
"qube, and so on. You can have as many qubes as you want! Most of the time, "
"you’ll be using an `app qube </user/reference/glossary.html#app-qube>`__, "
"which is a qube intended for running software programs like web browsers, "
"email clients, and word processors. Each app qube is based on another type "
"of qube called a `template </user/reference/glossary.html#template>`__. More"
" than one qube can be based on the same template. Importantly, a qube cannot"
" modify its template in any way. This means that, if a qube is ever "
"compromised, its template and any other qubes based on that template will "
"remain safe. This is what makes Qubes OS so secure. Even if an attack is "
"successful, the damage is limited to a single qube."

"Suppose you want to use your favorite web browser in several different "
"qubes. You’d install the web browser in a template, then every qube based on"
" that template would be able to run the web browser software (while still "
"being forbidden from modifying the template and any other qubes). This way, "
"you only have to install the web browser a single time, and updating the "
"template serves to update all the qubes based on it. This elegant design "
"saves time and space while enhancing security."

"There are also some “helper” qubes in your system. Each qube that connects "
"to the Internet does so through a network-providing `service qube "
"</user/reference/glossary.html#service-qube>`__. If you need to access USB "
"devices, another service qube will do that. There’s also a `management qube "
"</user/reference/glossary.html#management-qube>`__ that automatically "
"handles a lot of background housekeeping. For the most part, you won’t have "
"to worry about it, but it’s nice to know that it’s there. As with app qubes,"
" service qubes and management qubes are also based on templates. Templates "
"are usually named after their operating system (often a `Linux distribution "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution>`__) and corresponding "
"version number. There are many ready-to-use :doc:`templates "
"</user/templates/templates>` to choose from, and you can download and have "
"as many as you like."

"Last but not least, there’s a very special `admin qube "
"</user/reference/glossary.html#admin-qube>`__ which, as the name suggests, "
"is used to administer your entire system. There’s only one admin qube, and "
"it’s called `dom0 </user/reference/glossary.html#dom0>`__. You can think of "
"it as the master qube, holding ultimate power over everything that happens "
"in Qubes OS. Dom0 is more trusted than any other qube. If dom0 were ever "
"compromised, it would be “game over.” The entire system would effectively be"
" compromised. That’s why everything in Qubes OS is specifically designed to "
"protect dom0 and ensure that doesn’t happen. Due to its overarching "
"importance, dom0 has no network connectivity and is used only for running "
"the `desktop environment "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment>`__ and `window manager "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager>`__. Dom0 should never be used"
" for anything else. In particular, you should never run user applications in"
" dom0. (That’s what your app qubes are for!)"

"You’ll choose a **color** for each of your qubes out of a predefined set of "
"colors. Each window on your desktop will have its frame colored according to"
" the color of that qube. These colored frames help you keep track of which "
"qube each window belongs to and how trustworthy it is. This is especially "
"helpful when you have the same app running in multiple qubes at the same "
"time. For example, if you’re logged in to your bank account in one qube "
"while doing some random web surfing in a different qube, you wouldn’t want "
"to accidentally enter your banking password in the latter! The colored "
"frames help to avoid such mistakes."

"Most Qubes users associate red with what’s untrusted and dangerous (like a "
"red light: stop! danger!), green with what’s safe and trusted, and yellow "
"and orange with things in the middle. This color scheme also extends to "
"include blue and black, which are usually interpreted as indicating "
"progressively more trusted domains than green, with black being ultimately "
"trusted. Color and associated meanings are ultimately up to you, however. "
"The system itself does not treat the colors differently. If you create two "
"identical qubes — black and red, say — they’ll be the same until you start "
"using them differently. Feel free to use the colors in whatever way is most "
"useful to you. For example, you might decide to use three or four qubes for "
"work activities and give them all the same color — or all different colors. "
"It’s entirely up to you."

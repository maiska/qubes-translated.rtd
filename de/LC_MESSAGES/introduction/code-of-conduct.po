"This Code of Conduct is a collaborative, evolving document that attempts to "
"transparently set out a public set of standards regarding appropriate "
"conduct in the Qubes OS Project. It is *not* intended to be a statement or "
"endorsement, whether implicit or explicit, of any particular political or "
"philosophical attitude, belief, or way of living. Rather, it is an attempt "
"to find a reasonable middle ground among the inevitable disagreements "
"regarding free expression that arise in a large, diverse community of people"
" from around the world. It is intended to be a practical means of serving "
"the best interests of our users, contributors, and the project itself. We "
"welcome you to view the `history of changes "
"<https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-doc/commits/master/about/code-of-"
"conduct.md>`__ to this document and the `discussion "
"<https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/2163>`__ leading to its "
"creation."

"By default, the kernel that is installed in dom0 comes from the ``kernel`` "
"package, which is an older Linux LTS kernel. For most cases this works fine "
"since the Linux kernel developers backport fixes to this kernel, but for "
"some newer hardware, you may run into issues. For example, the audio might "
"not work if the sound card is too new for the LTS kernel. To fix this, you "
"can try the ``kernel-latest`` package – though be aware that it’s less "
"tested! (See `here </user/advanced-topics/how-to-install-software-in-"
"dom0.html#kernel-upgrade>`__ for more information about upgrading kernels in"
" dom0). In dom0:"

"Reboot when it’s done installing. You can double-check that the boot used "
"the newer kernel with ``uname -r``, which prints the version of the "
"currently-running kernel. Compare this with the output of ``rpm -q kernel``."
" If the start of ``uname -r`` matches one of the versions printed by "
"``rpm``, then you’re still using the Linux LTS kernel, and you’ll probably "
"need to manually fix your boot settings. If ``uname -r`` reports a higher "
"version number, then you’ve successfully booted with the kernel shipped by "
"``kernel-latest``."

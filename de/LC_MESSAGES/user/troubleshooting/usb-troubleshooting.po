"Currently (until issue `1082 <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-"
"issues/issues/1082>`__ gets implemented), if you remove the device before "
"detaching it from the qube, Qubes OS (more precisely, ``libvirtd``) will "
"think that the device is still attached to the qube and will not allow "
"attaching further devices under the same name. This may be characterized by "
"VM manager crashes and the error message: ``Houston, we have a problem``. "
"The easiest way to recover from such a situation is to reboot the qube to "
"which the device was attached. If this isn’t an option, you can manually "
"recover from the situation by following the instructions at the `Block "
"Devices documentation </user/how-to-guides/how-to-use-block-storage-"

"If a disposable template becomes compromised, then any disposable based on "
"that disposable template could be compromised. Therefore, you should not "
"make any risky customizations (e.g., installing untrusted browser plugins) "

"template is important because it is used by the “Open in disposable” "
"feature. This means that it will have access to everything that you open "

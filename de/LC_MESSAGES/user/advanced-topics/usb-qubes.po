"A USB qube acts as a secure handler for potentially malicious USB devices, "
"preventing them from coming into contact with dom0 (which could otherwise be"
" fatal to the security of the whole system). It thereby mitigates some of "
"the `security risks of using USB devices </user/security-in-qubes/device-"
"handling-security.html#usb-security>`__. Nonetheless, we strongly recommend "
"carefully reading the `security warning on USB input devices "
"</user/security-in-qubes/device-handling-security.html#security-warning-on-"
"usb-input-devices>`__ before proceeding."

"If you use a USB keyboard, there is a high risk of locking yourself out of "
"your system when experimenting with USB qubes. For example, if a USB qube "
"takes over your sole USB controller (to which your USB keyboard is "
"connected), then your keyboard will no longer be able to control dom0. This "
"will prevent you from performing many essential tasks, such as entering your"
" decryption and login passphrases, rendering your system unusable until you "
"reinstall. This section covers various options for addressing this problem."

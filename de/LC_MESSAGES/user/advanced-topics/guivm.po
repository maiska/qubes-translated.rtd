"In this section, we describe how to setup ``GuiVM`` in several case as "
"described in `GUI Domain <https://www.qubes-os.org/news/2020/03/18/gui-"
"domain/>`__. In all the cases, the base underlying TemplateVM used is "
"``Fedora`` with ``XFCE`` flavor to match current desktop choice in ``dom0``."
" That can be adapted very easily for other desktops and templates. By "
"default, the configured ``GuiVM`` is a management qube with global admin "
"permissions ``rwx`` but can be adjusted to ``ro`` (see `Introducing the "
"Qubes Admin API <https://www.qubes-os.org/news/2017/06/27/qubes-admin-"
"api/>`__) in pillar data of the corresponding ``GuiVM`` to setup. For "
"example, pillar data for ``sys-gui`` located at ``/srv/pillar/base/qvm/sys-"
"gui.sls``. Please note that each ``GuiVM`` has no ``NetVM``."

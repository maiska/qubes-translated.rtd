"It has three columns (from left to right): source, destination, and "
"permission. Each row is a rule. For example, the second row says that we’re "
"**allowed** (third column) to copy a file (since this is the policy file for"
" ``qubes.FileCopy``) **from** (first column) any VM tagged with “work” "
"**to** (second column) any VM tagged with “work”. In other words, all the "
"VMs tagged with “work” are allowed to copy files to each other without any "
"prompts. (If the third column were “ask” instead of “allow”, there would be "
"prompts. I.e., we would be **asked** to approve the action, instead of it "
"always being **allowed**.)"

"Now, the whole policy file is parsed from top to bottom. As soon as a rule "
"is found that matches the action being evaluated, parsing stops. We can see "
"what this means by looking at the third row. It says that we’re **denied** "
"from attempting to copy a file **from** any VM tagged with “work” **to** any"
" VM whatsoever. (That’s what the ``@anyvm`` keyword means – literally any VM"
" in the system, except for dom0). But, wait a minute, didn’t we just say (in"
" the second row) that all the VMs tagged with work are **allowed** to copy "
"files to each other? That’s exactly right. The second and third rows "
"contradict each other, but that’s intentional. Since we know that parsing "
"goes from top to bottom (and stops at the first match), we intentionally put"
" the second row above the third row so that it would take precedence. This "
"is how we create a policy that says: “VMs tagged with ‘work’ are allowed to "
"copy files to each other but not to any *other* VMs (i.e., not to VMs that "
"*aren’t* tagged with ‘work’).”"

"When an operation is initiated with a specific target, e.g. ``qvm-copy-to-vm"
" other_work_vm some_file`` the policy mechanism looks for a row matching "
"``source_work_vm other_work_vm PERMISSION``. In this case, assuming both VMs"
" have the ``work`` tag, the second row would match, and the operation would "
"be ``allow``\\ ed without any prompts. When an operation is initiated "
"without a specific target, e.g. ``qvm-copy some_file``, the policy mechanism"
" looks for a row matching ``source_work_vm @default PERMISSION``. In this "
"case, the first row indicates that the user should be prompted for the "
"destination. The list of destination VMs in the prompt is filtered to only "
"include VMs that are valid as per the policy (so in this example, only other"
" work VMs would be listed). If the first row was commented out, the second "
"row would not match (the ``@default`` placeholder is not included in "
"``@tag:work``) but the third row would match (the ``@default`` placeholder "
"is included in ``@anyvm``). The ``qvm-copy`` operation would therefore "
"terminate immediately with the message ``Request refused``, without "
"prompting the user with a list of valid destination VMs, and only ``qvm-"
"copy-to-vm`` operations with valid destinations would be allowed."

"The fourth row says that we’re **denied** from copying files **from** any VM"
" in the system **to** any VM tagged with “work”. Again, since parsing goes "
"from top to bottom, this doesn’t mean that no files can ever be copied from "
"*any* VM to a VM tagged with “work”. Rather, it means that only VMs that "
"match an earlier rule can do so (in this case, only VMs tagged with “work”)."

"The fifth and final row says that we’re **asked** (i.e., prompted) to copy "
"files **from** any VM in the system **to** any VM in the system. (This rule "
"was already in the policy file by default. We added the first four.) Note "
"that it wouldn’t make sense to add any rules after this one, since every "
"possible pair of VMs will match the ``@anyvm  @anyvm`` pattern. Therefore, "
"parsing will always stop at this rule, and no rules below it will ever be "
"evaluated."

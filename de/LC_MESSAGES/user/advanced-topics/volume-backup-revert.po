"With Qubes, it is possible to revert one of a VM’s storage volumes to a "
"previous state using the automatic snapshot that is normally saved every "
"time a VM is shutdown. (Note that this is a different, lower level activity "
"than the :doc:`Backup, Restoration, and Migration </user/how-to-guides/how-"
"to-back-up-restore-and-migrate>` process.)"

"In Qubes, when you create a new VM, it’s volumes are stored in one of the "
"system’s :doc:`Storage Pools </developer/system/storage-pools>`. On pool "
"creation, a revisions_to_keep default value is set for the entire pool. (For"
" a pool creation example, see :doc:`Storing app qubes on Secondary Drives "
"</user/advanced-topics/secondary-storage>`.) Thereafter, each volume "
"associated with a VM that is stored in this pool inherits the pool default "
"revisions_to_keep."

"The output of the above command will also display the “Available revisions "
"(for revert)” at the bottom. For a very large volume in a small pool, "
"revisions_to_keep should probably be set to the minimum value of 1 to "
"minimize the possibility of the pool being accidentally filled up by "
"snapshots. For a smaller volume for which you would like to have the future "
"option of reverting, revisions_to_keep should probably be set to at least 2."

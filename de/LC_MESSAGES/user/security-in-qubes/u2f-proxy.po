"`U2F <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U2F>`__, which stands for “Universal 2nd"
" Factor”, is a framework for authentication using hardware devices (U2F "
"tokens) as “second factors”, i.e. *what you have* as opposed to *what you "
"know*, like a passphrase. This additional control provides `good protection "
"<https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/google-security-keys-neutralized-"
"employee-phishing/>`__ in cases in which the passphrase is stolen (e.g. by "
"phishing or keylogging). While passphrase compromise may not be obvious to "
"the user, a physical device that cannot be duplicated must be stolen to be "
"used outside of the owner’s control. Nonetheless, it is important to note at"
" the outset that U2F cannot guarantee security when the host system is "
"compromised (e.g. a malware-infected operating system under an adversary’s "
"control)."

"The U2F specification defines protocols for multiple layers from USB to the "
"browser API, and the whole stack is intended to be used with web "
"applications (most commonly websites) in browsers. In most cases, tokens are"
" USB dongles. The protocol is very simple, allowing the devices to store "
"very little state inside (so the tokens may be reasonably cheap) while "
"simultaneously authenticating a virtually unlimited number of services (so "
"each person needs only one token, not one token per application). The user "
"interface is usually limited to a single LED and a button that is pressed to"
" confirm each transaction, so the devices themselves are also easy to use."

"Currently, the most common form of two-step authentication consists of a "
"numeric code that the user manually types into a web application. These "
"codes are typically generated by an app on the user’s smartphone or sent via"
" SMS. By now, it is well-known that this form of two-step authentication is "
"vulnerable to phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks due to the fact that "
"the application requesting the two-step authentication code is typically not"
" itself authenticated by the user. (In other words, users can accidentally "
"give their codes to attackers because they do not always know who is really "
"requesting the code.) In the U2F model, by contrast, the browser ensures "
"that the token receives valid information about the web application "
"requesting authentication, so the token knows which application it is "
"authenticating (for details, see `here "

"In a conventional setup, web browsers and the USB stack (to which the U2F "
"token is connected) are all running in the same monolithic OS. Since the U2F"
" model assumes that the browser is trustworthy, any browser in the OS is "
"able to access any key stored on the U2F token. The user has no way to know "
"which keys have been accessed by which browsers for which services. If any "
"of the browsers are compromised, it should be assumed that all of the "
"token’s keys have been compromised. (This problem can be mitigated, however,"
" if the U2F device has a special display to show the user what’s being "
"authenticated.) Moreover, since the USB stack is in the same monolithic OS, "
"the system is vulnerable to attacks like `BadUSB "

"In Qubes OS, by contrast, it is possible to securely compartmentalise the "
"browser in one qube and the USB stack in another so that they are always "
"kept separate from each other. The Qubes U2F Proxy then allows the token "
"connected to the USB stack in one qube to communicate with the browser in a "
"separate qube. We operate under the assumption that the USB stack is "
"untrusted from the point of view of the browser and also that the browser is"
" not to be trusted blindly by the token. Therefore, the token is never in "
"the same qube as the browser. Our proxy forwards only the data necessary to "
"actually perform the authentication, leaving all unnecessary data out, so it"
" won’t become a vector of attack. This is depicted in the diagram below "

"The Qubes U2F Proxy has two parts: the frontend and the backend. The "

"One very important assumption of U2F is that the browser verifies every "

"sending an authentication request matches the application that would be "

"phishing site from sending an authentication request for your bank’s site). "

"The Qubes U2F Proxy also prevents this class of attacks by implementing an "
"additional verification layer. This verification layer allows you to "
"enforce, for example, that the web browser in your ``twitter`` qube can only"
" access the U2F key associated with ``https://twitter.com``. This means that"
" if anything in your ``twitter`` qube were compromised — the browser or even"
" the OS itself — it would still not be able to access the U2F keys on your "
"token for any other websites or services, like your email and bank accounts."

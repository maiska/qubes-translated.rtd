"In :doc:`Getting Started </introduction/getting-started>`, we covered the "
"distinction in Qubes OS between where you *install* your software and where "
"you *run* your software. Your software is installed in `templates "
"</user/reference/glossary.html#template>`__. Each template shares its root "
"filesystem (i.e., all of its programs and system files) with all the qubes "
"based on it. `App qubes </user/reference/glossary.html#app-qube>`__ are "
"where you run your software and store your data."

"Firefox profile directory reliably to find malware hooks there). Also note "

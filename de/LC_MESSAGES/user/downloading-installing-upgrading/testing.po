"“Sufficient testing” is, in practice, a fluid term that is up the "

"A limitation of the current testing setup is that it is only possible to "
"migrate the *most recent version* of a package from ``current-testing`` to "
"``current``. This means that, if a newer version of a package is uploaded to"
" ``current-testing``, it will no longer be possible to migrate any older "
"versions of that same package from ``current-testing`` to ``current``, even "
"if one of those older versions has been deemed stable enough. While this "
"limitation can be inconvenient, the benefits outweigh the costs, since it "
"greatly simplifies the testing and reporting process."

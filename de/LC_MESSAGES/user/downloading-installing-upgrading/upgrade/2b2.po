"Existing users of Qubes R1 (but not R1 betas!) can upgrade their systems to "
"the latest R2 beta release by following the procedure below. As usual, it is"
" advisable to backup the system before proceeding with the upgrade. While it"
" is possible to upgrade the system **it is strongly recommended to reinstall"
" it**. You will preserve all your data and settings thanks to :doc:`backup "

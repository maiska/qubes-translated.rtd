"Create a standalone AppVM from the Fedora 32 template. Set private storage "
"to at least 60 GB if you will be building only the default templates; 100 GB"
" or more if you plan on additional. It’s not required, but if you allocate "
"additional CPU cores, the build process can utilize them at some steps such "
"as the kernel build. Likewise, more memory (up to 16 GB) can help. Last, you"
" may want to disable memory balancing, but keep in mind the impact on your "
"other qubes."

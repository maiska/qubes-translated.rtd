"Some keyboard layout set by KDE System Settings can cause `keyboard not "

"``/etc/sysconfig/keyboard``) and place correct keyboard layout settings "
"(details in linked thread). You can check if specific keyboard layout "

"On some systems the KDE Window Manager might freeze upon resuming from S3 "
"sleep when compositing is enabled (and the only method to log in to the "
"system if this happens is to switch to a text console, enter your user’s "
"password, kill the kwin process, go back to the Xorg console, log in, and "
"start a new instance of kwin using Konsole application :) If you experience "
"such problems, make sure to disable compositing before putting the system "
"into sleep by pressing Alt-Ctrl-F12 (and then enabling it back once you log "
"in after resume) – this way you should never see this problem again."

"default template in RC1, you should tell qvm-back-restore about that by "
"passing ``--replace-template`` option:"

"It preserves good content for older (but still supported) releases. Many "
"documentation contributors are also people who prefer to use the latest "
"release. Many of them are tempted to *replace* existing content that applies"
" to an older, supported release with content that applies only to the latest"
" release. This is somewhat understandable. Since they only use the latest "
"release, they may be focused on their own experience, and they may even "
"regard the older release as deprecated, even when it’s actually still "
"supported. However, allowing this replacement of content would do a great "
"disservice to those who still rely on the older, supported release. In many "
"cases, these users value the stability and reliability of the older, "
"supported release. With the older, supported release, there has been more "
"time to fix bugs and make improvements in both the software and the "
"documentation. Consequently, much of the documentation content for this "
"release may have gone through several rounds of editing, review, and "
"revision. It would be a tragedy for this content to vanish while the very "
"set of users who most prize stability and reliability are depending on it."

"It’s hard for readers to miss information they need, since it’s all in one "
"place. In the incorrect example, information that the reader needs could be "
"in any paragraph in the entire document, and there’s no way to tell without "
"reading the entire page. In the correct example, the reader can simply skim "
"the headings in order to know which parts of the page need to be read and "
"which can be safely ignored. The fact that some content is repeated in the "
"two release-specific sections is not a problem, since no reader has to read "
"the same thing twice. Moreover, as one release gets updated, it’s likely "
"that the documentation for that release will also be updated. Therefore, "
"content that is initially duplicated between release-specific sections will "
"not necessarily stay that way, and this is a good thing: We want the "
"documentation for a release that *doesn’t* change to stay the same, and we "
"want the documentation for a release that *does* change to change along with"
" the software."

"By contrast, an alternative approach, such as segregating the documentation "
"into two different branches, would mean that contributions that apply to "
"both Qubes releases would only end up in one branch, unless someone "
"remembered to manually submit the same thing to the other branch and "
"actually made the effort to do so. Most of the time, this wouldn’t happen. "
"When it did, it would mean a second pull request that would have to be "
"reviewed. Over time, the different branches would diverge in non-release-"
"specific content. Good general content that was submitted only to one branch"
" would effectively disappear once that release was deprecated. (Even if it "
"were still on the website, no one would look at it, since it would "
"explicitly be in the subdirectory of a deprecated release, and there would "
"be a motivation to remove it from the website so that search results "

"Qubes OS implements a security-by-isolation (or security-by-"
"compartmentalization) approach by providing the ability to easily create "
"many security domains. These domains are implemented as lightweight Virtual "
"Machines (VMs) running under the Xen hypervisor. Qubes’ main objective is to"
" provide strong isolation between these domains, so that even if an attacker"
" compromises one of the domains, the others are still safe. Qubes, however, "
"does not attempt to provide any security isolation for applications running "
"within the same domain. For example, a buggy web browser running in a Qubes "
"domain could still be compromised just as easily as on a regular Linux "
"distribution. The difference that Qubes makes is that now the attacker "
"doesn’t have access to all the software running in the other domains."

"Qubes also provides features that make it easy and convenient to run these "
"multiple domains, such as seamless GUI integration into one common desktop, "
"secure clipboard copy and paste between domains, secure file transfer "
"between domains, disposable VMs, and much more. Qubes also provides an "
"advanced networking infrastructure that allows for the creation of multiple "
"network VMs which isolate all the world-facing networking stacks and proxy "
"VMs which can be used for advanced VPN configurations and tunneling over "
"untrusted connections."

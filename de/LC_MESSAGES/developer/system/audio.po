"This is the dom0 (or Audio VM) part of the audio virtualization. It is "
"responsible for transferring audio samples between the PulseAudio daemon in "
"dom0/Audio VM (which has access to the actual audio hardware) and a VM "
"playing/recording sounds. A separate ``pacat-simple-vchan`` process runs in "
"dom0 for each VM with audio. Each of them opens separate input and output "
"streams to their local PulseAudio, which allows for controlling the volume "
"of each VM separately (using the ``pavucontrol`` tool, for example). In "
"order to (re)create a stream for a VM in dom0, ``pacat-simple-vchan`` can be"
" used. In order to find the needed parameters, domid and domain name, the "
"command ``xl list`` can be used."

"Qubes implements a security-by-compartmentalization approach. To do this, "
"Qubes utilizes virtualization technology in order to isolate various "
"programs from each other and even to sandbox many system-level components, "
"such as networking and storage subsystems, so that the compromise of any of "
"these programs or components does not affect the integrity of the rest of "
"the system."

"Qubes lets the user define many secure compartments known as `qubes "
"</user/reference/glossary.html#qube>`__, which are implemented as "
"lightweight `virtual machines (VMs) </user/reference/glossary.html#vm>`__. "
"For example, the user can have “personal,” “work,” “shopping,” “bank,” and "
"“random” app qubes and can use the applications within those qubes just as "
"if they were executing on the local machine. At the same time, however, "
"these applications are well isolated from each other. Qubes also supports "
"secure copy-and-paste and file sharing between qubes, of course."

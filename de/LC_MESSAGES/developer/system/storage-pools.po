"Qubes OS R3.2 introduced the concept of storage drivers and pools. This "
"feature was a first step towards a saner storage API, which is heavily "
"rewritten in R4. See `here <https://dev.qubes-os.org/projects/core-"
"admin/en/latest/qubes-storage.html>`__ for documentation on storage pools in"
" R4."

"A storage driver provides a way to store VM images in a Qubes OS system. "
"Currently, the default driver is ``xen`` which is the default way of storing"
" volume images as files in a directory tree like ``/var/lib/qubes/``."

"A storage pool driver can be identified either by the driver name with the "
"``driver`` key or by the class name like this: "
"``class=qubes.storage.xen.XenStorage``. Because R3.2 doesn’t use Python "
"``setup_hooks``, to actually use a short driver name for a custom storage "
"driver, you have to patch ``qubes-core-admin``. You can use the ``class`` "
"config key instead, when your class is accessible by ``import`` in Python."

"A pool (in R3.2) is configuration information which can be referenced when "
"creating a new VM. Each pool is saved in ``storage.conf``. It has a name, a "
"storage driver and some driver specific configuration attached."

"When installed, the system has, as you can see from the contents of "
"``/etc/qubes/storage.conf``, a pool named ``default``. It uses the driver "
"``xen``. The default pool is special in R3.2. It will add "
"``dir_path=/var/lib/qubes`` configuration value from "
"``defaults[pool_config]``, if not overwritten."

"Currently the only supported driver out of the box is ``xen``. The benefit "
"of pools (besides that you can write your own storage driver e.g. for Btrfs)"
" in R3.2 is that you can store your domains in multiple places."

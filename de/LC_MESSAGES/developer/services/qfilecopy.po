"In the early days of Qubes OS, for both cases, a block device (backed by a "
"file in dom0 with a vfat filesystem on it) was attached to VM, file(s) "
"copied there, and then the device was detached and attached to target VM. In"
" the DispVM case, if a edited file has been modified, another block device "
"is passed to requester VM in order to update the source file."

"In modern Qubes OS releases, we have reimplemented interVM file copy using "
"qrexec, which addresses the above mentioned disadvantages. Nowadays, even "
"more generic solution (qubes rpc) is used. See the developer docs on qrexec "
"and qubes rpc. In a nutshell, the file sender and the file receiver just "
"read/write from stdin/stdout, and the qubes rpc layer passes data properly -"
" so, no block devices are used."

"The rpc action for regular file copy is *qubes.Filecopy*, the rpc client is "

"Being a rpc server, *qfile-unpacker* must be coded securely, as it processes"
" potentially untrusted data format. Particularly, we do not want to use "
"external tar or cpio and be prone to all vulnerabilities in them; we want a "
"simplified, small utility, that handles only directory/file/symlink file "
"type, permissions, mtime/atime, and assume user/user ownership. In the "
"current implementation, the code that actually parses the data from srcVM "
"has ca 100 lines of code and executes chrooted to the destination directory."
" The latter is hardcoded to ``~user/QubesIncoming/srcVM``; because of "
"chroot, there is no possibility to alter files outside of this directory."

"A **Qubes canary** is a security announcement periodically issued by the "
"`Qubes security team </project-security/security.html#qubes-security-"
"team>`__ through the :doc:`Qubes security pack </project-security/security-"
"pack>` consisting of several statements to the effect that the signers of "
"the canary have not been compromised. The idea is that, as long as signed "
"canaries including such statements continue to be published, all is well. "
"However, if the canaries should suddenly cease, if one or more signers begin"
" declining to sign them, or if the included statements change significantly "
"without plausible explanation, then this may indicate that something has "
"gone wrong."

"The name originates from the practice in which miners would bring caged "
"canaries into coal mines. If the level of methane gas in the mine reached a "
"dangerous level, the canary would die, indicating to miners that they should"
" evacuate. See `Wikipedia: warrant canary "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary>`__ for more information, but "
"bear in mind that Qubes Canaries are not strictly limited to legal warrants."

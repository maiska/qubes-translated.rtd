"This tracker shows whether Qubes OS is affected by any given `Xen security "
"advisory (XSA) <https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/>`__. Shortly after a new XSA is"
" published, we will add a new row to this tracker. Whenever Qubes is "
"significantly affected by an XSA, a :doc:`Qubes security bulletin (QSB) "
"</project-security/qsb>` is published, and a link to that QSB is added to "
"the row for the associated XSA."

"installations are *currently* affected by any particular XSA. In fact, it is"
" extremely unlikely that any up-to-date Qubes installations are vulnerable "
"to any XSAs on this page, since patches are almost always published "
"concurrently with QSBs. Please read the QSB (if any) for each XSA for "
"patching details."

msgid "The Qubes OS Project uses the `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`__ standard. Version numbers are written as ``<major>.<minor>.<patch>``. When ``<patch>`` is zero, it is often omitted as a matter of convention, e.g., ``4.1`` is short for ``4.1.0``."

msgid "In general, patch releases are for backward-compatible bug fixes, minor releases are for backward-compatible enhancements and new features, and major release are for any backward-incompatible changes. This means that, in general, one should *not* try to introduce features or enhancements in patch releases or any backward-incompatible changes in patch or minor releases. (Templates are a notable exception, as upstream OSes almost always have their own release schedules.) Bug fixes are allowed in all releases, and backward-compatible changes are allowed in all major and minor releases."

msgid "Following standard practice, **version** refers to any build that has been assigned a version name or number, e.g., ``3.2-rc2``, ``4.0.4``, ``4.1-beta1``. By contrast, **release** refers to any version that is intended for consumption by the general userbase. For example, ``4.0.4`` was both a **version** and a **release**, since it was stable and intended for general public use, while ``4.1-beta1`` was a **version** but *not* a **release**, since it was not stable and was intended only for `testing </user/downloading-installing-upgrading/testing>`. All releases are versions, but not all versions are releases."

Please see :doc:`help, support, mailing lists, and forum </introduction/support>` for places to ask questions about stable releases. No major features and interface incompatibilities are to be included in this release. We release bug fixes as patch releases (``3.0.1``, ``3.0.2``, and so on), while backward-compatible enhancements and new features are introduced in the next minor release (e.g., ``3.1``). Any backward-incompatible changes are introduced in the next major release (e.g., ``4.0``)."

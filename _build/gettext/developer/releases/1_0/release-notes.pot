msgid "Some keyboard layout set by KDE System Settings can cause `keyboard not working at all <https://groups.google.com/group/qubes-devel/browse_thread/thread/77d076b65dda7226>`__. If you hit this issue, you can switch to console (by console login option) and manually edit ``/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-system-setup-keyboard.conf`` (and ``/etc/sysconfig/keyboard``) and place correct keyboard layout settings (details in linked thread). You can check if specific keyboard layout settings are proper using ``setxkbmap`` tool."

However, we do offer tools for smooth migration of your AppVMs. In order to do that, please backup your AppVMs using the ``qvm-backup`` tool :doc:`as usual </user/how-to-guides/how-to-back-up-restore-and-migrate>`. Then, after you install Qubes 1.0 rc1, you can restore them using ``qvm-backup-restore`` tool. However, because we have changed the default template in RC1, you should tell qvm-back-restore about that by passing ``--replace-template`` option:"

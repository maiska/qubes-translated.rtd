msgid "Create a standalone AppVM from the Fedora 32 template. Set private storage to at least 60 GB if you will be building only the default templates; 100 GB or more if you plan on additional. It’s not required, but if you allocate additional CPU cores, the build process can utilize them at some steps such as the kernel build. Likewise, more memory (up to 16 GB) can help. Last, you may want to disable memory balancing, but keep in mind the impact on your other qubes."

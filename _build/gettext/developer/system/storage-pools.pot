msgid "Qubes OS R3.2 introduced the concept of storage drivers and pools. This feature was a first step towards a saner storage API, which is heavily rewritten in R4. See `here <https://dev.qubes-os.org/projects/core-admin/en/latest/qubes-storage.html>`__ for documentation on storage pools in R4."

msgid "A storage driver provides a way to store VM images in a Qubes OS system. Currently, the default driver is ``xen`` which is the default way of storing volume images as files in a directory tree like ``/var/lib/qubes/``."

#: 92e9630c9d3d4323beb8d28280f46899
msgid "A storage pool driver can be identified either by the driver name with the ``driver`` key or by the class name like this: ``class=qubes.storage.xen.XenStorage``. Because R3.2 doesn’t use Python ``setup_hooks``, to actually use a short driver name for a custom storage driver, you have to patch ``qubes-core-admin``. You can use the ``class`` config key instead, when your class is accessible by ``import`` in Python."

msgid "A pool (in R3.2) is configuration information which can be referenced when creating a new VM. Each pool is saved in ``storage.conf``. It has a name, a storage driver and some driver specific configuration attached."

msgid "When installed, the system has, as you can see from the contents of ``/etc/qubes/storage.conf``, a pool named ``default``. It uses the driver ``xen``. The default pool is special in R3.2. It will add ``dir_path=/var/lib/qubes`` configuration value from ``defaults[pool_config]``, if not overwritten."

msgid "Currently the only supported driver out of the box is ``xen``. The benefit of pools (besides that you can write your own storage driver e.g. for Btrfs) in R3.2 is that you can store your domains in multiple places."

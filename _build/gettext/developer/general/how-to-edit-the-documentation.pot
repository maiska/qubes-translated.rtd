This process is designed to ensure that contributed text is accurate and non-malicious. This process is a best effort that should provide a reasonable degree of assurance, but it is not foolproof.

However, binaries, such as images, are simply checked to ensure they appear or function the way they should when the website is rendered. They are not further analyzed in an attempt to determine whether they are malicious."

In cases in which another reviewer is not required, the documentation maintainer may review the pull request (in which case no signed comment is necessary, since it would be redundant with the signed tag)."

Note that special permissions may be required to use some of these commands. These commands are generally issued by adding a comment to a PR containing only the command."

msgid "``TestDeploy``: Deploys a test website, which is a live version of the Qubes website as if this PR had been merged. This can be useful for previewing a PR on a live public website. **Note:** You must wait for the site to finish building before issuing this command, or else it will deploy an empty website. To find the URL of the test website, look for text similar to “This branch was successfully deployed” and a button named something like “View deployment.” Note that there are two different testing sites: ``wwwtest`` is manually updated, whereas ``wwwpreview`` is managed by the ``TestDeploy`` command."

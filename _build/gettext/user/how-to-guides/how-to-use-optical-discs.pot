msgid "To access an optical disc via USB follow the `typical procedure for attaching a USB device </user/how-to-guides/how-to-use-usb-devices.html#with-the-command-line-tool>`__, then check with the **Qubes Devices** widget to see what device in the target qube the USB optical drive was attached to. Typically this would be ``sr0``. For example, if ``sys-usb`` has device ``3-2`` attached to the ``work`` qube’s ``sr0``, you would mount it with ``mount /dev/sr0 /mnt/removable``. You could also write to a disc with ``wodim -v dev=/dev/sr0 -eject /home/user/Qubes.iso``."

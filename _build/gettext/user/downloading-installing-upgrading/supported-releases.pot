As a courtesy to Qubes users, we attempt to pass along any upstream EOL notices we receive for officially-supported templates, but our ability to do this reliably is dependent on the upstream distribution’s practices. If a distribution provides a mailing list similar to `qubes-announce </introduction/support.html#qubes-announce>`__, which allows us to receive only very important, infrequent messages, including EOL announcements, we are much more likely to be able to pass along EOL notices to Qubes users reliably. Qubes users can always check the EOL status of an upstream release on the upstream distribution’s website (see `Fedora EOL <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/End_of_life>`__ and `Debian Releases <https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases>`__)."

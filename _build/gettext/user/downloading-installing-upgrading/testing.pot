msgid "Every new update is first uploaded to the ``security-testing`` repository if it is a security update or ``current-testing`` if it is a normal update. The update remains in ``security-testing`` or ``current-testing`` for a minimum of one week. On occasion, an exception is made for a particularly critical security update, which is immediately pushed to the ``current`` stable repository. In general, however, security updates remain in ``security-testing`` for two weeks before migrating to ``current``. Normal updates generally remain in ``current-testing`` until they have been sufficiently tested by the community, which can last weeks or even months, depending on the amount of feedback received (see `Providing feedback <#providing-feedback>`__)."

msgid "A limitation of the current testing setup is that it is only possible to migrate the *most recent version* of a package from ``current-testing`` to ``current``. This means that, if a newer version of a package is uploaded to ``current-testing``, it will no longer be possible to migrate any older versions of that same package from ``current-testing`` to ``current``, even if one of those older versions has been deemed stable enough. While this limitation can be inconvenient, the benefits outweigh the costs, since it greatly simplifies the testing and reporting process."

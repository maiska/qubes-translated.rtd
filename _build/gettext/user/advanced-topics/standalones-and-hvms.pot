Unlike templates, however, standalones do not supply their root filesystems to other qubes. Examples of situations in which standalones can be useful include:"

Normally, you install digitally signed software from Red Hat/Fedora repositories, and it’s reasonable that such software has non malicious *installation* scripts (rpm pre/post scripts). However, when you would like to install some packages from less trusted sources, or unsigned, then using a dedicated (untrusted) standalone might be a better way."

In practice, however, it is most common for standalones to be HVMs and for HVMs to be standalones. Hence, this page covers both topics."

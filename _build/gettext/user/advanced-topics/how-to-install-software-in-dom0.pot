msgid "Since there is no networking in dom0, any bugs discovered in dom0 desktop components (e.g., the window manager) are unlikely to pose a problem for Qubes, since none of the third-party software running in dom0 is accessible from VMs or the network in any way. Nonetheless, since software running in dom0 can potentially exercise full control over the system, it is important to install only trusted software in dom0."

msgid "The install/update process is split into two phases: *resolve and download* and *verify and install*. The *resolve and download* phase is handled by the UpdateVM. (The role of UpdateVM can be assigned to any VM in the Qube Manager, and there are no significant security implications in this choice. By default, this role is assigned to the FirewallVM.) After the UpdateVM has successfully downloaded new packages, they are sent to dom0, where they are verified and installed. This separation of duties significantly reduces the attack surface, since all of the network and metadata processing code is removed from the TCB."

msgid "Although this update scheme is far more secure than directly downloading updates in dom0, it is not invulnerable. For example, there is nothing that the Qubes OS Project can feasibly do to prevent a malicious RPM from exploiting a hypothetical bug in the cryptographic signature verification operation. At best, we could switch to a different distro or package manager, but any of them could be vulnerable to the same (or a similar) attack. While we could, in theory, write a custom solution, it would only be effective if Qubes repos included all of the regular template distro’s updates, and this would be far too costly for us to maintain."

msgid "If the disk is completely full, you will get an ``Out of disk space`` error that may crash your system because Dom0 does not have enough disk space to work. So it’s good practice to regularly check disk space usage. Running the ``df -h`` command in dom0 terminal will show some information, but not include all the relevant details. The Qubes user interface provides a disk space widget. If you are unable to access the interface, the command line version is running ``sudo lvs | head`` and looking at top entry for LVM pool. For example:"

As you can see, the ``sudo lvs | head`` command includes additional important columns ``Data%`` and ``Meta%``, shown in the above example to have the values 89% and 69% respectively."

msgid ":doc:`Resizing a volume </user/advanced-topics/resize-disk-image>` in the Qubes interface should be a straightforward process. But sometimes, an attempt to resize will look like it worked, when it in fact fails silently. If you then try the same operation in the dom0 console using the ``qvm-volume extend`` command, it fails with the error message: ``resize2fs: Permission denied to resize filesystem``. This error indicates that a ``resize2fs`` will not work, unless ``fsck`` is run first. Qubes OS utilities cannot yet handle this case."

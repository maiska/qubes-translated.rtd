msgid "Despite Qubes shipping with :doc:`Debian Templates </user/templates/debian/debian>`, most of Qubes core components run on Fedora and thus our documentation has better coverage for Fedora. However, Qubes has been working closely with the `Whonix <https://whonix.org>`__ project which is based on Debian."

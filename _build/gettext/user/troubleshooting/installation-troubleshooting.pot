Some laptops cannot read from an external boot device larger than 8GB. If you encounter a black screen when performing an installation from a USB stick, ensure you are using a USB drive less than 8GB, or a partition on that USB less than 8GB and of format FAT32. Note that the Qubes installation image is over 4GB, so it may not fit on a smaller USB. If a machine can not boot from a bigger USB, it may be too old to run Qubes."

If installation fails after using one tool, try a different one. For example, if you are facing trouble installing Qubes after writing the ISO using Rufus, then try using other tools like balenaEtcher or the ``dd`` command. In case the boot partition is not set to “active” after copying the ISO, you can use some other tool like ``gparted`` on a Linux system to activate it."

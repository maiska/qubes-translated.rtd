msgid "This Code of Conduct is a collaborative, evolving document that attempts to transparently set out a public set of standards regarding appropriate conduct in the Qubes OS Project. It is *not* intended to be a statement or endorsement, whether implicit or explicit, of any particular political or philosophical attitude, belief, or way of living. Rather, it is an attempt to find a reasonable middle ground among the inevitable disagreements regarding free expression that arise in a large, diverse community of people from around the world. It is intended to be a practical means of serving the best interests of our users, contributors, and the project itself. We welcome you to view the `history of changes <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-doc/commits/master/about/code-of-conduct.md>`__ to this document and the `discussion <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/2163>`__ leading to its creation."

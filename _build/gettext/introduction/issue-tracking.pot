msgid "In the case of bugs, the package containing the change will move to the appropriate :doc:`testing </user/downloading-installing-upgrading/testing>` repository, then to the appropriate stable repository. If you so choose, you can test the fix while it’s in the :doc:`testing </user/downloading-installing-upgrading/testing>` repository, or you can wait for it to land in the stable repository. If, after testing the fix, you find that it does not really fix the reported bug, please leave a comment on the issue explaining the situation. When you do, we will receive a notification and respond on the issue or reopen it (or both). Please **do not** create a duplicate issue or attempt to contact the developers individually about a problem."

If the issue is closed without one of these specific resolutions, then it means, by default, that the reported bug was fixed or the requested enhancement was implemented."

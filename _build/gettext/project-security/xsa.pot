msgid "This tracker shows whether Qubes OS is affected by any given `Xen security advisory (XSA) <https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/>`__. Shortly after a new XSA is published, we will add a new row to this tracker. Whenever Qubes is significantly affected by an XSA, a :doc:`Qubes security bulletin (QSB) </project-security/qsb>` is published, and a link to that QSB is added to the row for the associated XSA."

Therefore, if an XSA pertains *only* to DoS attacks against Qubes, the value in the “Is Qubes Affected?” column will be **No**."

msgid "For simplicity, we use the present tense (“is affected”) throughout this page, but this does **not** necessarily mean that up-to-date Qubes installations are *currently* affected by any particular XSA. In fact, it is extremely unlikely that any up-to-date Qubes installations are vulnerable to any XSAs on this page, since patches are almost always published concurrently with QSBs. Please read the QSB (if any) for each XSA for patching details."
